        A Madrid legend, Iker Casillas is the best goalkeeper in Real Madrid's history and in the history of Spanish football. He arrived at the club aged 9 and wore the Whites shirt for 25 years. Throughout that time he became one of the benchmarks in the club's history, winning the respect, affection and admiration of Madrid supporters.
